                    <h2>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h2>
                    <p>Ms Ann Njambi and Ms Charity Muturi provided invaluable feedback on the virtual 
                        support network in Kenya (page 39).</p>
                        <p> PG: This work wouldn’t have occurred without funding and support from the Mozilla 
                        Foundation. Thanks to Jenn Beard and all Mozilla Fellows of 2019-20. Invaluable feedback 
                        on an early draft was provided by A/Prof Nev Jones. Stephanie Slack, Timothy Kariotis 
                        and David Clifford assisted at different drafting stages. Support from the Melbourne Law 
                        School and its Office for Research, as well as the Melbourne Social Equity Institute, was 
                        also crucial. The report was partly produced with funding from the Australian Research 
                        Council (project no. DE200100483).</p>
                        <p> KU: I want to acknowledge the co-authors of this paper, and a special acknowledgment 
                        for Piers Gooding for modeling that our future technologies should be more than just 
                        inclusive of lived experience, but fully integrate the people who will be most impacted 
                        by the proposed solutions to co-create and co-develop culturally responsive real mental 
                        health solutions that respond to our needs.</p>
